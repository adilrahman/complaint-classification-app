## ABOUT
  - This model will analyze complaints and classify them into different categories like Credit reporting, Debt collection and Mortgages and loans ...etc
  - It could be used to streamline the routing and processing of incoming messages for an organization and can simplify the complaint-submission process for consumers.
  - The dataset is collected from Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)

As part of that mission, consumers can send in complaints when they feel theyâ€™ve been mistreated by a credit bureau, a bank, a credit card company, or another financial service provider.
